This package is co-designed by 'the memelab' during the MARIN Baltic Sea Residency. Launch the application, and wait for a GPS fix (you will see the letters 'GPS' turn green).  Consult the map, or simply wander.  When you have a match, both 'LAT' and 'LON' will turn green, you will see the name of the audio file associated with that location, and you can press the 'P' button for the audio file to play, and the 'S' button for it to stop.  The 'R' button records a new file with the name you enter in the 'TAG' field.
